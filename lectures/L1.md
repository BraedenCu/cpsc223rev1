# what is C
### a programming language
an imperative programming language - differentiated from functional languages, a program is a sequence of steps
### a compiled programming language

# C is an imperative language

imperative language
```c
long fac(int n) {
    long f=1;
    while(n>0) {
        f*=n;
        n--;
    }
    return f;
}
```
# C is a compiled langugae
- source code -> machine code -> binary code 
- interpreted languages are slower than compiled languages
# C is a high level language
```c
while (n>0) {
    f*=n;
    n--;
}
return f;
```
- this gets converted into low-level language (assembly), each line of the assembly code gets converted into one single machine language instruction
- low level lang -> processor dependent
- high level lang -> processor independent

# High level language (C)
- independent of hardware
- explicitly allocate and deallocate memory
- very few built-in types and constructs
- limited standard library
- weak type system -> will not tell you if you try to treat something as the wrong type
- static types

# Higher-level lanugage (python)
- independent of hardware
- memory is managed by the runtime
- huge collection of built-in constructs and types
- extensive standard library
- strong type system -> will tell you if you try to treat something as the wrong type
- dynamic types
