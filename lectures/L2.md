# Lecture Two

## Compilation Continued

### Executing C programs
- gcc (filename)
- ./(assember-prescribed name).out <- execute a.out

### Fundamentals of C programs

- most C programs are made up of multiple source code files
- these files are combined into a single executable using Linking (#include)
  - header files (.h) exist to make it easier to read programs because they only display the key information (function definitions, global variables, etc.) rather than showing all of the unecessary implementation details of a .c file
  - Lets say you want to link two files, factorial.c libfac.c and libfac.h. gcc factorial.c libfac.c is necessary to produce the output a.out because factorial.c relies on libfac.c, the header file is only included as a reference within factorial.c, this code is then linked by the "linker" within the compiler
- The lifecycle of a c program
  - Source code -> preprocessor -> compiler -> assembler -> linker -> executable code
    - Preprocessor -> expanded code -> compiler
    - Compiler -> assembly code -> assembler
    - Assembler -> object code -> linker
    - linker -> libraries, other object files -> executable code
  - More details on linker -> executable
    - Linker -> loader
    - Loader -> disk memory gets shifted into primary memory, loader places the program into memory
    - CPU -> CPU takes each instruction and executes it, possibly storing new data values as the program executes
- Source files vs header files
  - Source files describe your programs **implementation**
  - Header files describes your programs **interface**
    - These header files tell us what a program **does**
    - They separate the "what" from the "how"
    - These are abstractions
### First Program in C
```c
#include <stdio.h> // directive to the C preprocessor which tells the preprocessor to include the contents of standard I/O header
int main(void) // main functions begins the program execution without receiving arguments
{
    char answer;
    printf("Are you ready? "); // printf statement prints the standard output
    scanf("%c", &answer); // scanf statement reads input from standard input
    if (anwer == 'y') {
        printf("welcome to 223!\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("maybe later...\n");
    }
    return 0; // indicates that the program ended successfully
}
```
- Main two ways to write a main function, one with and the other without parameterss
```c
int main(void)  // main function
int main(       // main function that utilizes parameter values
    int argc,   // argc stands for 'argument count' which gives the # of arguments that are passed when the program is executed
    char *argv[] )  // argv stands for 'argument vector' which gives you access to the passed arguments

```
### Make and Makefiles
- Compilation with gcc
  - if you only run gcc it will compile everything and give you the output file, simply use **gcc**
  - if, for example, you were recompiling a project that utilizes lots of files and there is an issue in only a few or a single file, therefore you would not want to recompile everything. in this case, you would use **gcc -c**
- Object files
  - The compiler links files by connecting function calls to function bodies
  - A function prototype helps the type checker but says nothing about the function body
  - gcc -c foo.c means “compile but don’t link foo.c”
    - Generates an object file named foo.o
    - Contains the machine instructions for all code in foo, but the locations of called function bodies are left “blank”
- The problem with object files
  - you ***must*** regenerate an object file each time you modify a source file
  - You don't have to regenerate object files of source files that you didn't modify
  - This is the problem of ***dependency management***
  - To alleviate this, we use ***Make***
- Automation to the rescue: ***Make***
  - For large or complex projects, we can automate the build process to recompile all and only the source files we modified since our last build
  - Lots of tools for this, Make, Maven, Npm, Conda
  - Essentially these programs look for changes and recompile automatically in a way that avoids the drawbacks we just discussed
### Make at a glance
  - Make figures out automatically which files it needs to update
  - Automatically determines proper order for updating files
  - if u change a few source files and run Make, it updates only those non-source files that depend directly or indirectly on the source files you changed
  - Not limited to any particular language
  - Make knows what to do based on the commands in a ***makefile***

### Makefiles at glance
- Lists all non-source files and defines how to compute them from the source files
  - each non-source file is a target
- A rule tells Make a series of commands to execute to build a target file from source files
- It also specifies a list of dependencies of the target file
- Simple rules look like the following: target: dependencies commands ...
- The executable name defaults to a.out
- Example of a makefile
```
a.out: factorial.o libfac.o
    gcc factorial.o libfac.o

factorial.o: factorial.c
    gcc -c factorial.c

libfac.o: libfac.c
    gcc -c libfac.c

```

## Programming in C

### General Outline
- Every C program has a main function that includes two parameters
  - int argc - "argument count"
  - char *argv[] - "argument values"
- the main function is the ***entry point*** for a C program
  - the program searches for a main function on execution
  - the system supplies the values for argc and argv based upon the command that executed the program

### Variables
- a variable is a name for a location in memory
- manipulating variables changes the state of memory -> ***programming is simply this***
- every variable has a type
  - type is the set of all possible values a variable can hold
- C has several basic built-in types
  - int, char, double, float, long, Pointer

### Functions
- Building blocks of C programs
  - Encapsulate complex behavior
  - Abstract implementation details
  - Reduce or eliminate repeated code
```c
int sqrt(int x) { // return type = int, func name = sqrt, (___) = parameters
    // beginning of function body
    int the_sqrt = x; 
    return x; // return statement of defined type (int)
}
```
- to call a function, simply use its name followed by arguments listed in ()
  - The number and types of arguments ***must*** match those in the function definition
- Control is transferred from the calling function to the body of the called function
```c
int sqrt(int x);
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int s = sqrt(169);
    printf("%d\n", s);
}
```
### if else statements
- Control flow statements
- 
```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
    if (argc == 1)
    {
        char name[2000];
        printf("Enter your name: ");
        scanf("%1999[^\n]", name);
        printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
    }
    else 
    {
        printf("Hello, %s!\n", argv[1]);
    }
}
```

### while statements
```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    while(1==1) {
        printf("Will run forever");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Memory: a primer
- Memory is composed if many ***bytes***
- Each byte has an ***address***
- Your ***operating system*** organizes memory into ***blocks***
- ***C*** organizes memory into two parts
  - "The Stack"
  - "The Heap"
- The value of each variable is stored on ***the stack***
- ***EVERYTHING ELSE*** is stored in ***the heap***
- A variable is a name for a location in memory, aka a name on the stack
- when you refer to a variable, you refer to the variable's ***value***
- if you were to examine the variables location, you would see a sequence of bits
- Levels of abstraction
  - transistors -> logic gates -> bits -> bytes -> int, double, char ... -> all integers, all real numbers, ...
  - "the value of int variable x is 89" -> really means -> the sequence of bits at the location in memory named x corresponds to the abstract value 89 when interpreted as an int"
- Always think about variables in terms of their mathematical model

### The Stack
- when a variable is ***declared*** space is allocated for it on the ***stack***
- the ***value*** of the variable is stored in the allocated space
- each variable has a ***scope***
  - ***scope*** is the portion of the program in which the variables value is accessible
  - A variable is in-scope once it is declared
  - A variable goes out of scope at the end of the block in which it was declared
    - scope is ***inherited*** by nested blocks
    - scope is ***not inherited*** by called function bodies
  
## Input/Output
- standard streams files
- to do ***any*** input and output in C, you must include stdio
  - #include <stdio.h>, stdio.h = standard intput/output header
  - basic functions of stdio.h
    - size_t, FILE, EOF, stdin, stdout, stderr
    - int printf()
    - int scanf()
    - char *gets()
    - int getchar()
- Standard streams
  - a program communicates with its environment via ***streams***
  - a stream is an abstraction of a file
  - when a program is launched from the terminal
    - ***stdin*** collects keyboard input
    - ***stdout*** writes output to the display
    - ***stderr*** writes outut to the display
  - User can redirect the output or intput using an execution command
    - Input: $ ./myprog < new_in.txt
    - Output: $ ./myprog > new_out.txt
    - Error: $ ./myprog 2> new_err.txt
